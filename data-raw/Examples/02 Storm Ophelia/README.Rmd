title:  Example 2 - Exploring Storm Ophelia
---
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

```

The data set can be explored for specific events. For example, on October 16th 2018, Storm Ophelia landed in Ireland. We can analyse this data using **dplyr** and **ggplot2**. First, we load the libraries.

```{r,echo=T,message=FALSE}
library(aimsir17)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

Next, we filter the observations for this date.


```{r,echo=T}
o <- observations %>%
  filter(date>"2017-10-16", date <"2017-10-17")
o
```

Next, we can take the stations that had the lowest atmospheric pressure (say 5 lowest)

```{r,echo=T}
lowest <- o %>% arrange(msl) %>% slice(1:5) %>% pull(station)
lowest
```
