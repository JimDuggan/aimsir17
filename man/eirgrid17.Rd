\item{Modifications}{New columns added to the data for Year, Month, Day, Hour and Minute. Columns representing GMT offset removed.
The column date transformed to a `POSIXct` type. Furthermore, note that:
The system data in this report is is based on average 15-minute SCADA readings (MW).
All figures represent net exported energy.
Maximum/Minimum figures in the different jurisdictions do not necessarily occur at the same time.
The maximum SNSP limit allowed on the system is 65%.
SNSP may exceed this maximum limit due to wind variations.}
